//create local development database
//(after writing all the db context and startup config code)
dotnet ef database update
//create the migration. "MyInitialDb" is not special. I could have given it any name.
dotnet ef migrations add MyInitialDb
//run the migration (creates the tables)
dotnet ef database update

dotnet ef migrations add SeedData
